Project Name:
Smart Dairy IoT Dashboard – Cow Monitoring & Yield Prediction System

Project Description / Prompt:
Build a full-stack web dashboard that helps farmers monitor their cows in real-time using RFID/ear tags, sensors, and predictive analytics. The dashboard should track individual cow identity, health, location, milk yield, feed recommendations, and profit estimation.

Core Modules to Implement:
1. Cow Identification Module

Add cows using ID (RFID tag), breed, DOB, weight, lactation stage.

Each cow gets a detailed profile page.

Sync ear tag ID → Cow data.

2. Real-Time Dashboard Overview

Show key farm metrics:

Total cows

Cows in lactation

Today’s milk yield

Total feed required today

Health alerts

Profit estimate

Use responsive cards + charts.

3. Cow List & Status Table

A searchable table containing:

Cow ID

Breed

Age

Health score

Today’s milk yield

Feed required

Status alerts

Clicking a row opens the full profile.

4. Farm Map View (Layout)

A simple top-view schematic of the farm.

Display cow icons with status colors (Healthy = green, Risk = yellow, Alert = red).

If GPS data available → show position.

If no GPS → show activity zone (feeding area/milking area).

5. Milk Yield Monitoring

Input actual milk yield manually (Phase 1).

Display daily/weekly/monthly milk charts.

Provide predicted yield based on:

Breed

Lactation stage

Feed intake

Past trends

Health score

6. Feeding Recommendation Engine

For each cow, calculate:

Green fodder needed

Dry fodder needed

Concentrate (kg)

Minerals

Based on:

Breed

Weight

Lactation stage

Milk yield

Season

Also show:

Feed cost per day

Expected milk output

Net profit per cow

7. Health Monitoring

Dashboard shows:

Temperature trends (if sensor data available)

Activity score

Rumination score (if data provided)

Alerts for fever, low activity, abnormal milk drop

Generate a Health Score (0–100) using rules.

8. Profit & Analytics Module

Daily profit

Per-cow profit

Monthly farm profit

Feed cost vs Milk revenue chart

Identify:

High-performing cows

Low-performing cows

Disease risk cows

9. Backend Requirements

Node.js + Express backend

REST API for cow data, feed data, yield data

Store data in Firebase / Supabase / Replit DB

API endpoint structure:

/cows

/cows/:id

/yield/:id

/feed/:id

/health/:id

10. Frontend Requirements

React / Next.js / Vite-React

Components:

Dashboard

Cow Detail

Map View

Feed Calculator

Milk Chart

Alerts Panel

Use TailwindCSS for clean UI

Use Recharts for graphs

11. Optional Phase 2 Enhancements

BLE/LoRa sensor integration

Auto data sync

Mobile app mode

Voice assistant for farmers

Offline mode

⚡ Expected UI Style

Clean, modern farm-tech feel

White + Gray + Green accents

Minimal, data-focused

Icons for cows, alerts, feed, milk

📌 Goal

Create a scalable, affordable dairy management system for a farmer with 25 cows, with real-time monitoring, prediction, and analytics.
